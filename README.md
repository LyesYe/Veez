# The project objectives & goals

- Kids love screen time, but if you want your child to do a little less Pokémon chasing and a little more learning, there’s good news. our app combines technology and education to make learning more engaging, interactive, and—dare we say—*fun*
 than ever before.
- Veez **helps young kids understand and grab new vocabulary in a different language from a young age.**
- The app makes them learn by offering the possibility to visualize the world while making the world around them turn alive.
- our goal is to reach as many kids as we can, and spread this culture of “early education”


# Application content:

our character will always be there at the corner when the camera is on , he willl talk with u and make comments , and explain additional stuff sometimesss

## Learning languages

   ### Object Detection
   - The first approach would be Using your phone camera in order to live scan your entourage and detecting random objects , the detected object will be highlighted , its name appears under it and even its pronunciation.
   
   ### Environment Detection (Situation)
   - scanning your entourage with a picture you would take, a character appears and make a conversation with you, explaining to you where u are and some additional details about that place.
   - this process will be using VPR , **Visual Place Recognition**
     
   ### How:
   
   1- Detecting keypoints     
   2- Describing them 
        
   The keypoints represent the important locations in the image, such as unique ones that differentiate it from any other environment. They are detected robustly by applying an algorithm to the needed image 
        
   3- Quiz to test the knowledge
      - quizz about stuff he learned or even words he learnt like “how do we say orange in arabic”
